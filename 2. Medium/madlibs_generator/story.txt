Today I went to the {place} and saw a very {adjective} {animal}.
It was {verb_ing} near the {noun} while wearing a {adjective2} {clothing}.
Everyone around started to {verb} because it looked so {adjective3}.

Suddenly, my best friend {name} shouted, 
"That is the most {adjective4} thing I have ever seen!"

In the end, we both decided to {verb2} and eat some {food}.
It was a truly {adjective5} day.
