# Python Mini Projects 🐍

This repository contains a collection of **Python mini projects** that I am building as part of my learning journey.  
The projects are organized from **easy to hard**, with the goal of strengthening core programming concepts and improving problem-solving skills.

Rather than just following tutorials, these projects focus on **hands-on implementation**, logical thinking, and writing clean, readable code.
